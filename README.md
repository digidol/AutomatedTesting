AutomatedTesting
================

This repository contains materials for the Automated Testing workshop at 
[RUCK Workshops 2014](http://www.ruckworkshops.com/ "Ruck Workshops Website"). The 
workshop will is intended for those who are new to automating the test process. 

The 3-hour workshop will focus on the use of unit testing with Java programs, but also 
touch on the use of a build tool to control the process and set the work in the context 
of Continuous Integration. 

You don't need prior experience of the Java programming language, 
we will cover what you need to know in the workshop. 

The workshop materials will be made available in this repository on the day of 
the workshop.
